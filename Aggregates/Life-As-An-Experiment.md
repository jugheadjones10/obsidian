# Life As An Experiment

## 2025-12-27 [[Life#2025-12-27#Life As An Experiment|↩]]

- I find that on days that I cannot fall asleep easily, I turn to Youtube, which inevitably leads to like a 4am bedtime and a late wakeup the next day. Instead, read a novel or something, which can help you fall asleep more easily.
- If you need to do something you dread doing...do something more fun instead, and once you are in your flow you can do the harder thing. Like a gateway drug.
