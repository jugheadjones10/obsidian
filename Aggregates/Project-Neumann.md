# Project Neumann

## 2025-12-23 [[Life#2025-12-23#Project Neumann|↩]]

What if I feed an LLM every single flashcard I made for a chapter and the original chapter text, and then ask it to think hard to generate hard variants of my flashcards that really drill into my conceptual understanding of the topics? Make it go section by section of the chapter. That might be a good way to add good cards for a chatper.
