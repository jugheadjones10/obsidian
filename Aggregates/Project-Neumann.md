# Project Neumann

- Maybe I need to memorise content pages as well? So that I can list out every topic and sub-topic learned from a textbook, and create a map of concepts in my mind that I can traverse at will.
- I want to try experimenting how well different models are at converting content into flashcards. Not for math, but for the kind of content that involves more memory than conceptual understanding, like Linux commands, or Operating System facts.

What if I feed an LLM every single flashcard I made for a chapter and the original chapter text, and then ask it to think hard to generate hard variants of my flashcards that really drill into my conceptual understanding of the topics? Make it go section by section of the chapter. That might be a good way to add good cards for a chatper.
