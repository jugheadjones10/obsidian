# Teebloc

### Answer key cropping
We know that there are many different types of answer keys. Here are the categories encountered so far:
- Grid view, with one column.
	- For this, what if we train a YOLO model to identify all rows, and then we use a light Gemini model to label the question number of rows as well as decide whether each row is a continuation of an existing question or now.
- Grid view, with two columns.
	- Similar approach to one column, except we might need to train a different YOLO model?
- Similar to questions, except with the answers filled in.
